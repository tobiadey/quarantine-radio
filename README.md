# quarantine-radio (Created in 2020)


# Create a virtual environment using the /env folder

Project needs to implement better use of websockets to allow for other users to listen to the same song rather than each user listening to their own songs and being allowed to chat with each other in specific rooms.


# What is Quarantine Radio
A project that utilised the Spotify API to devise an interesting approach to replicate going to a club/bar during quarantine - allowing users create rooms to stream music.

Constructed the application utilising Python(Flask) to manage endpoints, PostgresSQL for updating and querying the database and JavaScript for using socket.io for chatting and handling requests to /responses from the Spotify API.
